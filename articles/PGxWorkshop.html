</h2>
<p>This tutorial, titled Pharmacogenomic Analysis of Drug Combination
Experiments to Identify Biomarkers of Response or Resistance, focuses on
using the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/PharmacoGx" class="external-link">PharmacoGx</a></em>
R package to correlate treatment response, measured as the viability of
cancer cell-lines after <em>in vitro</em> drug treatment, with their
respective multi-omic profiles. <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/CoreGx" class="external-link">CoreGx</a></em>
provides the core infrastructure for storing, analyzing and visualizing
generic treatment response experiments. It provides functions and
classes which can be inherited in downstream packages, such as <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/ToxicoGx" class="external-link">ToxicoGx</a></em>
and <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/RadioGx" class="external-link">RadioGx</a></em>.
We hope that the <code>CoreSet</code> object is generalized enough that
it can be reused by other developers for their specific treatment
response use case.</p>

<p>PharmacoGx stores drug screening data together with molecular
profiling of cell lines in an object called a <code>PharmacoSet</code>,
or <code>PSet</code> for short. This object inherits for the
<code>CoreSet</code> class defined in our package <code>CoreGx</code>,
which abstracts the common functionality across our similar
packages.</p>

</h4>
<p>To facilitate modularization of the GxSuite of R packages, we are
shifting the nomenclature within a <code>CoreSet</code>–and therefore in
inheriting packages –to be more general.</p>
<p>To this end, we are making the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previous reference to cell (cell-line) will become sample, allowing
the <code>CoreSet</code> to be used for other model systems</li>
<li>Drug (radiation in <code>RadioGx</code>) will become treatment,
allowing the <code>CoreSet</code> to be treatment type agnostic</li>
<li>Sensitivity will become response (sensitivty slot becomes
treatmentResponse)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these changes, the names of some common accessors will
be updated. The old accessors will still remain, ensuring backwards
compatibility for at least two Bioconductor releases. A deprecation
warning will be added to old accessors informing users of the
corresponding new function, as per Bioconductor best practices.</p>

<p>The field of precision oncology is increasingly interested in
exploring possible synergies between cancer therapies. To simplify the
process of translating drug combination experiments conducted in cancer
model systems, we have extended the <code>CoreSet</code> and
<code>PharmacoSet</code> classes with a new object, the
<code>TreatmentResponseExperiment</code>, which has been specifically
designed to handle combination experiments. While drug combinations are
the first use case for this data structure, as cancer model systems
continue to advance we expected to also see sample-wise combinations.
For example, 3D organoid models could include multiple cell-lines or
patient tissue types.</p>

</h2>
<p>Understanding monotherapy dose-viability data is an important step in
assessing drug combination response. Drug synergy is assessed by
comparing the observed combination response compared to what is expected
from the response of cells to each drug separately. While different
models for “expected” combination effect will be discussed in the next
section, we first review how monotherapy data is analyzed.</p>
<p>Monotherapy dose-response experiments are usually analyzed by first
fitting a dose-viability model to the observed measurements. The most
common model used in the literature is a form of sigmoid function,
called the Hill Curve. The Hill Curve has its basis in the
Michaelis-Menten chemical kinetics model, while adding an extra
parameter to account for co-operativity of binding. To better match real
observed data, the model can also be extended to include parameters
controlling the maximum and minimum observed viability.</p>
<p><em>NB: Sometimes, dose-viability and dose-response curves are used
interchangebly in the literature. Precisely, dose-response curves for a
cell kiling screen would plot % cell death against dose, leading to an
increasing sigmoid curve.</em></p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.16/PharmacoGx" class="external-link">PharmacoGx</a></em>,
we use the 3 Parameter Hill Curve function as our model of drug response
in cancer cell lines:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = E_\infty + \frac{1-E_\infty}{1 +
(\frac{x}{EC50})^{HS}}\]</span> This is a log-logistic model, meaning
that it takes the form of a logistic curve when x is on the log scale.
The three parameters are: <span class="math inline">\(E_\infty\)</span>,
which is the maximal inhibition predicted at infinite concentration of
the drug (the right asymptote); <span class="math inline">\(EC50\)</span>, which is the inflection point of
the logit, where the inhibition reaches 50% of the maximum; <span class="math inline">\(HS\)</span>, the Hill Slope, which is a measure of
the cooperativity of binding. This parameter controls the steepness of
the logit, and is interpreted based on its relation to 1. Values larger
than 1 imply positive cooperativity in inhibition/binding of the target
for the small molecule ligands, which values less than 1 imply negative
cooperativity/antagonism.</p>

<p>PharmacoGx provides functions to both fit and visualize
dose-viability curves. Plotting dose-viability data is easy using the

<p>Note that sometimes, it is may be more appropriate to use either a 2
parameter model (excluding the <span class="math inline">\(E_\infty\)</span> parameter), or a 4 parameter
model, including a parameter for the left-assymptote, that is, the
measurement when no drug is added. <code>PharmacoGx</code> is opiniated
in using the 3 parameter model, as the logical value for the viability
as a percentage of untreated cells when no drug is added is 100%.
However, the <code>drc</code> CRAN package provides a larger variety of
dose-response models, should it be appropriate in your application.</p>
<p>We will soon demonstrate how to apply the
<code>logLogisticRegression</code> to dose-viability data stored in a

<p>Often with <em>in vitro</em> Pharmacogenomics data, we want to
compare the drug sensitivity of a cell line to some omic features. For
this, we want to summarize the drug dose response curve into a single

<h2 id="drug-combination-synergy-models">Drug Combination Synergy Models<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#drug-combination-synergy-models"></a>
</h2>
<p>When assessing drug combinations, the question of interest is usually
not to quantify drug response to the therapy, but to identify
combinations that give more or less response to therapy than expected
from the monotherapy regiments, that is, to look for synergy or
antagonism. Alternatively, for a paritcular drug combination, we may be
interested to identify which biological models show synergy or
antagonism, and understand why that could be the case on a molecular
level.</p>
<p>For these tasks, it is important to define what we expect the result
of combining two drugs at a particular combination to be without the
presence of any synergy or antagonism between them. Usually, when
searching for synergy, will have access to experiments testing each drug
in monotherapy, as well as the drugs in combination. For our discussion,
we we restrict ourselves to the two-drug combination case, however, the
principles we discuss can be extended to handle multiple drugs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no consensus of what the theoretical expected
value of response for combining two drugs is, given the response that
each drug elicits in monotherapy. However, there are three models widely
applied in the literature, each with different biological assumptions
behind them.</p>
<p>To introduce these models, we will define some mathematical notation,
which we will use both throughout our exposition and the example
computations. Let <span class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{2}\)</span> correspond to the corresponding
drug 1 and drug 2 doses at which we wish to predict the expected
combination response. Let <span class="math inline">\(v_{1}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(v_{2}\)</span> be the viabilities that are
observed in monotherapy for these drugs, and <span class="math inline">\(v_{c}\)</span> be the viability observed in
combination. Furthermore, let <span class="math inline">\(r_{i} = 1 -
v_{i}\)</span> be the response value corresponding to each measured
viability. We will use both response and viability measurements in
explaining the models, as some are more natural from one or the other
perspective. However, it is easy to convert between these variables
using the relationship above.</p>
<p>When we look for drug synergy, we are looking for cases where <span class="math inline">\(v_c &lt; v_{model}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(r_c &gt; r_{model}\)</span>. The degree of synergy
is usually measured either on the additive or multplicative scale, that
is, looking at either <span class="math inline">\(v_c -
v_{model}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(v_c /
v_{model}\)</span>. However, some models, such as the ZIP described
below, also perscribe a certain perspective to assess synergy.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="highest-single-agent-highest-single-effect">Highest Single Agent / Highest Single Effect<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#highest-single-agent-highest-single-effect"></a>
</h3>
<p>The simplest model that one can assume for the response of drugs in
combination is the Highest Single Agent model. This model predicts that
the result of treating with two drugs is the same as the highest
response (or lowest viability) seen by treating with either drug
independently. Mathematically, this is equivalent to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[HSA((r_1,x_1), (r_2,x_2)) =
\mbox{max}(r_1, r_2)\]</span></p>
<p>For viability values, this flips to a minimum.</p>
<p>Intuitively, this model can be interpreted as assuming that one
compound is at the maximum possible effect, and the other is treated as
a potentiator, contributing little to the response itself, but allowing
the maximum response of the first drug to be increased. Practically,
this case is not very often observed during in-vitro dose-response
experiments, and the highest single agent model is often a very weak
baseline from which to compute synergy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="bliss-independence">Bliss Independence<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bliss-independence"></a>
</h3>
<p>Bliss Independence can be understood by making the assumption that
cell death from treatment with a drugs is a stochastic process with the
probability of cell death being proportional to the response observed in
the experiment. The model than assumes that the cell death events from
the two drugs are independent, for example because they occur through
completely separate pathways. As such, the model predicts that adding a
second drug will kill the same fraction of cells as it kills on its own,
and therefore the fractions of cells remaining alive are caculated by
multplying the fraction of cells alive after treatment with drug 1 in
monotherapy, with the fraction of cells alive after treatment with drug
2 in monotherapy. Mathematically, that works out to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[BLISS((v_1,x_1), (v_2,x_2)) = v_1
v_2\]</span></p>
<p>In response units this is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[BLISS((r_1,x_1), (r_2,x_2)) = r_1 + r_2
- r_1*r_2\]</span></p>
<p>This model is always going to be more strict that HSA (as long as
response is between 0 and 1), and is usually a more practical assumption
to make when searching for drug synergy. Intuitively, one can think of
it as modeling the case where the two drugs have separate mechanisms,
with synergy signifiying a biological interaction that makes them more
effective than expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="loewe-additivity">Loewe Additivity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loewe-additivity"></a>
</h3>
<p>Loewe Additivity comes from a different assumption on what the effect
of adding two drugs should be. While Bliss Independence assumes that the
drugs act independently, for example through different pathways, Loewe
assumes that in the null case, adding <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> concentration of a second drug should
lower the viability as if we added a proportional amount of the same
drug, with that proportion caculated according to the relative efficacy
of the two drugs at the final combination viability. This proportinal
relationship is defined implicity at each predicted value of $v_{loewe}
by the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{x_1}{X^{loewe}_1} +
\frac{x_2}{X^{loewe}_2} = 1\]</span></p>
<p>where $ X^{loewe}_1 $ is the concentration of drug 1 required to
achieve <span class="math inline">\(v_{loewe}\)</span> on its own, and
similarly for $ X^{loewe}_2$ and drug 2. Translating this to english, it
assumes that we can lower the concentration of drug 1 needed to see the
same effect by replacing the missing dose with a similar amount of drug
2, adjusted for the difference in potency between the two drugs.</p>
<p>Practically, this formula is not very useful for estimating <span class="math inline">\(v_{loewe}\)</span> from actual dose-response data.
However, if we assume that drug response follows a Hill Curve model, we
can define <span class="math inline">\(y_{loewe}\)</span> implicitly
using the parameters <span class="math inline">\(HS_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(EC50_{1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(E_{\infty,1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(HS_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(EC50_{2}\)</span>, and $E_{,2} by rearranging the
Hill Curve relationship as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x = EC50 *
(\frac{v-1}{v-E_{\infty}})^{\frac{1}{HS}}\]</span></p>
<p>We can then plug this relationship in to get an emplicit formula for
<span class="math inline">\(v_{loewe}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{x_1}{EC50_1 *
(\frac{v_{loewe}-1}{v_{loewe}-E_{\infty,1}})^{\frac{1}{HS_1}}} +
\frac{x_2}{EC50_2 *
(\frac{v_{loewe}-1}{v_{loewe}-E_{\infty,2}})^{\frac{1}{HS_2}}} =
1\]</span></p>
<p>This formula can then be solved numerically in practice to find the
value of <span class="math inline">\(v_loewe\)</span> for any two
particular fitted curves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="zip">ZIP<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zip"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Zero interaction Potency model was recently introduced with the
goal of capturing the ideas behind both the Bliss and Loewe assumptions.
As the name implies the model assumes that the two drugs do not
“potentiate” each other, meaning, that the only difference between the
dose response curves of Drug 1 with and without Drug 2 present is that
the presence of Drug 2 changes the baseline response, without affecting
the potency of Drug 1. The authors were then able to show that the ZIP
model can be derived from multiplying the two fitted Dose-Response
curves together. <!-- TODO: Finish me  --></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="picking-a-null-drug-combination-model">Picking a Null Drug Combination Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#picking-a-null-drug-combination-model"></a>
</h3>
<p>Given the fact that there is no universal consensus on which null
model is correct in all cases, when analyzing drug combination data, a
choice must be made by the analyst. Ideally, this choice would be made
according to reasonable assumptions about the drugs and their mechanisms
of action. For example, for two compounds which inhibit targets
converging on the same pathway, the Loewe model may be most appropriate,
whereas for drug combinations with completely unrelated mechanisms,
Bliss may be a more natural choice.</p>
<p>However, practical considerations may also limit your choices. For
both the Loewe and ZIP approaches, one needs enough points to be
measured to be able to fit Hill Curves to the available data. For Loewe,
this needs to be done only in monotherapy, while for ZIP, both
monotherapy and combination data must have sufficient points to fit a
curve. On the other hand, both HSA and Bliss can be computed from the
raw measurements of monotherapy viability, not requiring any models of
the dose-response data to be fit.</p>
<p>In general, we would recommend using a model which makes stronger
assumptions than HSA, which is the weakest of the presented models. If
the number of tested doses is low (&lt;6), the Bliss model is probably
the reference of choice, even though it is know to be quite strict. When
possible to calculate, the ZIP approach has advantages in a
high-throughput setting, where it would be difficult to pick between
Bliss and Loewe a-priori for each individual combination.</p>
