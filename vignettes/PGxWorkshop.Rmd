# Workshop Overview {-}

*This workshop is currently under development!*

## Instructor(s) name(s) and contact information

* Christopher Eeles <christopher.eeles@uhnresearch.ca>
* Petr Smirnov <petr.smirnov@utoronto.ca>
* Benjamin Haibe-Kains <benjamin.haibe.kains@utoronto.ca>

## Workshop Description {-}

This workshop will introduce users to the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")` and
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` R packages, which are useful tools for
pharmacogenomic modelling to discover biomarkers of treatment response in cancer
model systems. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` specifically focuses on
drug sensitivity experiments in cancer cell lines, which will be the major
focus of this workshop. Additional infrastructure from our lab includes
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ToxicoGx")` for toxicogenomics in healthy human
cell-lines, `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("RadioGx")` for
radiogenomics in cancer cell-lines and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Xeva")` for
pharmacogenomics in patient derived xenograph (PDX) murine models.

Participants will learn the fundamentals of using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")`
and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` to create a `PharmacoSet`&mdash;an
integrative container for the storage, analysis and visualization of
pharmacogenomic experiments. Particular focus will be placed
on newly developed support for storing, analyzing and visualizing drug
combination sensitivity experiments and correlating results therefrom for
with multi-omic molecular profiles to discover biomarkers of drug senstivity
or resistance.

### Pre-requisites
* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Knowledge of or interest in pharmacogenomics
* Familiarity with core Bioconductor classes such as the `SummarizedExperiment`
and `MultiAssayExperiment`
* Curiosity or experience about `data.table` an assest!

### Workshop Participation

**Interactive Portion in Development, will be updated when needed.**


Participants expected to have the following required packages installed on their machines to be able to run the commands along with the instructors.
CoreGx and PharmacoGx from Bioconductor, data.table from CRAN.
<!-- The workshop will be presented as a set of analysis steps to be replicated by the learners, with instructors available to explain the why and how of applying these functions to the given datasets. Learners will write analysis scripts as well as use interactive commands to explore the generated data structures and results. Learners will then brainstorm potential applications of the analysis results in their field as well as comment on use case examples presented by the instructors on research in our lab. -->

# Introduction to CoreGx and PharmacoGx

This tutorial, titled Pharmacogenomic Analysis of Drug Combination Experiments
to Identify Biomarkers of Response or Resistance, focuses on using the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` R package to correlate treatment response,
measured as the viability of cancer cell-lines after _in vitro_ drug treatment,
with their respective multi-omic profiles. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")`
provides the core infrastructure for storing, analyzing and visualizing generic
treatment response experiments. It provides functions and classes which can be
inherited in downstream packages, such as `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ToxicoGx")` and
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("RadioGx")`. We hope that the `CoreSet` object is
generalized enough that it can be reused by other developers for their specific
treatment response use case.

## PharmacoGx

PharmacoGx stores drug screening data together with molecular profiling of
cell lines in an object called a `PharmacoSet`, or `PSet` for short. This object
inherits for the `CoreSet` class defined in our package `CoreGx`, which abstracts
the common functionality across our similar packages.

<!--
## CoreGx

{r coreset,  echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**CoreSet class diagram**. Objects comprising a `CoreSet` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./CoreSetClassDiagram.png")
-->

### Package Nomenclature

To facilitate modularization of the GxSuite of R packages, we are shifting
the nomenclature within a `CoreSet`&ndash;and therefore in inheriting packages
&ndash;to be more general.

To this end, we are making the following changes:

* Previous reference to cell (cell-line) will become sample, allowing the
`CoreSet` to be used for other model systems
* Drug (radiation in `RadioGx`) will become treatment, allowing the
`CoreSet` to be treatment type agnostic
* Sensitivity will become response (sensitivty slot becomes treatmentResponse)

As a result of these changes, the names of some common accessors will be updated.
The old accessors will still remain, ensuring backwards compatibility for at
least two Bioconductor releases. A deprecation warning will be added to old
accessors informing users of the corresponding new function, as per Bioconductor
best practices.


# Overview of Data Structures

The GxSuite of packages make use of various Bioconductor classes for storing
molecular profile data.

## CoreSet

__Need to update the class diagram__

## PharmacoSet

The basic structure of a PharmacoSet is as follows:

<!--
r pharmacoset, echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**PharmacoSet class diagram**. Objects comprising a `PharmacoSet` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./PharmacoGxClassDiagram.png")

-->

## TreatmentResponseExperiment

<!--
{r treatmentresponseexperiment, echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**TreatmentResponseExperiment class diagram**. Objects comprising a `TreatmentResponseExperiment` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}

# How TRE Support Drug Combinations Data Analysis

## Drug Combination Experiments

The field of precision oncology is increasingly interested in exploring possible
synergies between cancer therapies. To simplify the process of translating
drug combination experiments conducted in cancer model systems, we have extended
the `CoreSet` and `PharmacoSet` classes with a new object, the
`TreatmentResponseExperiment`, which has been specifically designed to handle
combination experiments. While drug combinations are the first use case for
this data structure, as cancer model systems continue to advance we expected
to also see sample-wise combinations. For example, 3D organoid models could
include multiple cell-lines or patient tissue types.
