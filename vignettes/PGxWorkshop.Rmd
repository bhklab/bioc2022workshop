# Workshop Overview {-}

*This workshop is currently under development!*

## Instructor(s) name(s) and contact information {-}

* Christopher Eeles <christopher.eeles@uhnresearch.ca>
* Accepting volunteers! Who wants to help?

## Workshop Description {-}

This workshop will introduce users to the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")` and 
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` R packages, which are useful tools for 
pharmacogenomic modelling to discover biomarkers of treatment response in cancer 
model systems. PharmacoGx specifically focuses on drug sensitivity experiments 
in cancer cell lines, which will be the major focus of this workshop. 

Participants will learn the fundamentals of using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")` 
and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` to create a `PharmacoSet`&mdash;an 
integrative container for the storage, analysis and visualization of 
pharmacogenomic experiments. Particular focus will be placed on newly developed 
support for storing, analyzing and visualizing drug combination sensitivity 
experiments and correlating results therefrom with multi-omic molecular 
profiles to discover biomarkers of drug senstivity or resistance.

Additional infrastructure from our lab includes`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ToxicoGx")` 
for toxicogenomics in healthy human cell-lines, `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("RadioGx")`  
for radiogenomics in cancer cell-lines and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Xeva")` 
for pharmacogenomics in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. To learn
more about these additional packages, see our
[Bioc2020 Workshop](http://bhklab.ca/bioc2020workshop/articles/GxWorkshop.html)

# Introduction

This tutorial, titled Pharmacogenomic Analysis of Drug Combination Experiments 
to Identify Biomarkers of Response or Resistance, focuses on using the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` R package to correlate treatment response, 
measured as the viability of cancer cell-lines after _in vitro_ drug tre#atment, 
with their respective multi-omic profiles. `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("CoreGx")` 
provides the core infrastructure for storing, analyzing and visualizing generic 
treatment response experiments. It provides functions and classes which can be 
inherited in downstream packages, such as `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ToxicoGx")` and 
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("RadioGx")`. We hope that the `CoreSet` object is 
generalized enough that it can be reused by other developers for their specific 
treatment response use case.

## PharmacoGx

PharmacoGx stores drug screening data together with molecular profiling of 
cell lines in an object called a `PharmacoSet`, or `PSet` for short. This object
inherits for the `CoreSet` class defined in our package `CoreGx`, which abstracts
the common functionality across our similar packages.

<!--
## CoreGx

{r coreset,  echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**CoreSet class diagram**. Objects comprising a `CoreSet` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./CoreSetClassDiagram.png")

# Package Nomenclature

To facilitate modularization of the GxSuite of R packages, we are shifting
the nomenclature within a `CoreSet`&ndash;and therefore in inheriting packages
&ndash;to be more general.

To this end, we are making the following changes:

* Previous reference to cell (cell-line) will become sample, allowing the 
`CoreSet` to be used for other model systems
* Drug (radiation in `RadioGx`) will become treatment, allowing the 
`CoreSet` to be treatment type agnostic
* Sensitivity will become response (sensitivty slot becomes treatmentResponse)

As a result of these changes, the names of some common accessors will be updated.
The old accessors will still remain, ensuring backwards compatibility for at
least two Bioconductor releases. A deprecation warning will be added to old 
accessors informing users of the corresponding new function, as per Bioconductor
best practices.


# Data Structures Overview

The GxSuite of packages make use of various Bioconductor classes for storing
molecular profile data. 

## CoreSet

__Need to update the class diagram__

## PharmacoSet

The basic structure of a PharmacoSet is as follows:

```{r pharmacoset, echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**PharmacoSet class diagram**. Objects comprising a `PharmacoSet` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./PharmacoGxClassDiagram.png")
```


## TreatmentResponseExperiment

```{r treatmentresponseexperiment, echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**TreatmentResponseExperiment class diagram**. Objects comprising a `TreatmentResponseExperiment` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./LongTableClassDiagram.png")
```

## MultiAssayExperiment


```{r mutliassayexperiment, echo=FALSE, fig.wide=TRUE, fig.cap = "**MutliAssayExperiment class diagram**. Objects comprising a `MutliAssayExperiment` are enclosed in boxes. The first box indicates the type and name of each object. The second box indicates the structure of an object or class. The third box shows accessor methods from `PharmacoGx` for that specific object. '=>' represents return and specifies what is returned from that item or method."}
knitr::include_graphics("./LongTableClassDiagram.png")
```

# New Features for Drug Combination Support

## Installing the Development packages

__This section is temporary, until all changes are pushed to Bioconductor__

Because the package changes for this workshop are not complete or tested yet,
we will need to install the development packages directly from GitHub.

```{r install_github_pkgs, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("bhklab/CoreGx@development")
remotes::install_github("bhklab/PharmacoGx@development")
```

```{r install_bioc_pkgs, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("MultiAssayExperiment"))
    BiocManager::install("MultiAssayExperiment")
```

```{r install_cran_pkgs, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("data.table"))
    install.packages("data.table", type = "source") # compile locally
```

## Drug Combination Experiments

The field of precision oncology is increasingly interested in exploring possible
synergies between cancer therapies. To simplify the process of translating 
drug combination experiments conducted in cancer model systems, we have extended
the `CoreSet` and `PharmacoSet` classes with a new object, the 
`TreatmentResponseExperiment`, which has been specifically designed to handle
combination experiments. While drug combinations are the first use case for
this data structure, as cancer model systems continue to advance we expected
to also see sample-wise combinations. For example, 3D organoid models could
include multiple cell-lines or patient tissue types.

# Building a Drug Combiation PharmacoSet

`PharmacoSet` object from raw data.
