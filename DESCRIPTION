Description: This workshop will introduce users to the CoreGx and PharmacoGx R 
    packages, which are useful tools for pharmacogenomic modelling to discover 
    biomarkers of treatment response in cancer model systems. PharmacoGx 
    specifically focuses on drug sensitivity experiments in cancer cell lines, 
    which will be the major focus of this workshop. Additional infrastructure 
    from our lab includes ToxicoGx for toxicogenomics in healthy human 
    cell-lines, RadioGx for radiogenomics in cancer cell-lines and Xeva for 
    pharmacogenomics in patient derived xenograph (PDX) models.
