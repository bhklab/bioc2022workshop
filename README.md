## Workshop Description
This workshop will introduce users to the CoreGx and PharmacoGx R packages,
which are useful tools for pharmacogenomic analysis to discover biomarkers of
treatment response in cancer model systems. PharmacoGx specifically focuses on
drug sensitivity experiments 

### Pre-requisites
* Familiarity with
