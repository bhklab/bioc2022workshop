## Workshop Description
This workshop will introduce users to the CoreGx and PharmacoGx R packages,
which are useful tools for pharmacogenomic modelling to discover biomarkers of
treatment response in cancer model systems. PharmacoGx specifically focuses on
drug sensitivity experiments in cancer cell lines, which will be the major
focus of this workshop. Additional infrastructure from our lab includes
ToxicoGx for toxicogenomics in healthy human cell-lines, RadioGx for
radiogenomics in cancer cell-lines and Xeva for pharmacogenomics in patient
derived xenograph (PDX) murine models.

Participants will learn the fundamentals of using CoreGx and PharmacoGx to
create a PharmacoSet &mdash an integrative container for the storage, analysis and
visualization of pharmacogenomic experiments. Particular focus will be placed
on newly developed support for storing, analyzing and visualizing drug 
combination sensitivity experiments and correlating results therefrom for
multiomic biomarker discovery. 

### Pre-requisites
* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Knowledge of or interest in pharmacogenomics
* Familiarity with core Bioconductor classes such as the `SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment`
* Curiosity or experience about `data.table` an assest!
